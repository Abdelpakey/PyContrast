## PyContrast

This repo lists recent contrastive learning methods, and includes as a set of reference implementations.

### Awesome-Contrastive-Learning
Find a list of contrastive learning [paper](AWESOME_CONTRASTIVE_LEARNING.md)

### PyTorch Code of SoTA Contrastive Learning Methods
For the reference implementation of SoTA methods, (e.g., InstDis, CMC, MoCo, ...), see [pycontrast](pycontrast).

### SoTA unsupervised pre-trained models
A set of ImageNet unsupervised pre-trained models that outperforms their supervised counterparts 
when transferring to COCO and Pascal VOC. Find them in [MODEL_ZOO.md](pycontrast/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md)
